### Your task

This is the outline of what you need to do. The recommended way of doing each step is covered in the "Cheat Sheet" but you may wish to try solving it for yourself first.

 1. Should explain in short steps how to tackle the task
 1. Try not to give everything away in these steps
 1. Full instructions (including commands/paths etc) should be provided on the next page/‘cheat sheet’
 1. Number all your items `1.` in markdown and they will be numbered for you when rendered. 

### Questions to test yourself

All too easy? Here are some questions to test your knowledge an understanding. You might find the answers by exploring the [JASMIN Documentation](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk)

1. What is...?
1. Why do you need to...?

### Review / alternative approaches / best practice

Give a summary here about what they should now know how to do by completing the exercise. E.g. ‘By completing this exercise you can now do X, this could also be applied to Y’s workflow. Put details in some slides to accompany the exercise.
Could also include examples of different pointers of ways to complete the exercise (if appropriate).
"You can do it in slightly different ways using Z.ß

### Cheat Sheet

This page, or multiple pages, should have a detailed example of how to work through the exercise. Including specific commands and paths than need to be used. Plus any other hints/tips that might be useful - like links to help documentation.

### Formatting

Hopefully the examples above show how basic MarkDown formatting works.
Looking at the MarkDown source for this file shows how to format a [link](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf), while following the link itself takes you to a MarkDown Syntax CheatSheet.

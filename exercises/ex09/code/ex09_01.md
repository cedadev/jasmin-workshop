# Exercise 09.01: Using Conda Environments in the Notebook Service

### Scenario

I want to install packages of my own choice into a virtual environment, and 
then run this as a kernel in the notebook service. The JASMIN Notebook Service:

- provides an interactive programming interface through a web browser
- includes a set of python libraries for data analysis
- can read directly from the CEDA Archive
- can include formatted documentation and visualisations within a Notebook
- will enable you to use virtual environments from a local directory.

### Objectives

After completing this exercise I will be able to:

- create a conda environment
- install the `ipykernel` module and set up my environment as a kernel for the notebook service.
- access my kernel to apply to a specific notebook.
- run the notebook to produce some outputs. Examples:
    - create visualisations in a notebook
    - write outputs to the JASMIN file system
    - add inline annotations to a notebook

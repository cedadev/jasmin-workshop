# jasmin-workshop
Materials and code for JASMIN workshops.

The workshop makes use of the exercises listed below to enable users to become familiar with the JASMIN environment.
If you are unable to attend one of the workshops in person, you may find it useful to watch the following [Overview Presentation](https://youtu.be/ScmLvdgqAUw) which is normally given at the workshop:


| Exercise | Topic |
| --- | --- |
| [ex01](./exercises/ex01) | Connecting to JASMIN |
| ex02 | TODO |
| [ex03](./exercises/ex03) | Transferring and sharing data |
| ex04 | TODO |
| ex05 | TODO |
| ex06 | TODO |
| ex07 | TODO |
| ex08 | TODO |
| ex09 | TODO |

If you are using the materials individually (outside of an organised workshop event) then you will need to use your own JASMIN account and a group workspace which you already belong to, rather than the training accounts, and `workshop` group workspace, respectively. Instead of the `workshop` LOTUS queue, please use the `test` queue in this case.

The following tutorials are also available: these are not interactive like the exercises, but provide in-depth explanations and demonstrations.

| Tutorial | Topic |
| --- | --- |
| [t01](./tutorials/t01) | Re-useable, re-runnable workflows |

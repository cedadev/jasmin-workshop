If you are using the materials individually (outside of an organised workshop event) then you will need to use your own JASMIN account and a group workspace which you already belong to, rather than the training accounts, and `workshop` group workspace, respectively. Instead of the `workshop` LOTUS account and QoS, please use the account of a group workspace you belong to and the `debug` QoS in this case.

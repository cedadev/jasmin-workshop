If you are using the materials individually (outside of an organised workshop event) then you will need to use your own JASMIN account and a group workspace which you already belong to, rather than the training accounts, and `workshop` group workspace, respectively. Instead of the `workshop` LOTUS queue, please use the `test` queue in this case.
